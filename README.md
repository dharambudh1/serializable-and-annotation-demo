# Serializable & Annotation Demo

## Description:
This Flutter project showcases the usage of JSON serializable and annotations. JSON serializable is a library in Flutter that simplifies the serialization (converting data structures to JSON) and deserialization (converting JSON to data structures) process. Annotations are used to configure how classes and fields should be serialized and deserialized.

  - JSON Serialization:
    - JSON serialization is the process of converting Dart objects into JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. This is particularly useful when working with APIs that send or receive data in JSON format. The JSON serializable library in Flutter automates this process by generating the serialization code for your Dart classes based on annotations.

  - Annotations
    - Annotations in Flutter are metadata that provide additional information about your Dart code. In the context of JSON serialization, annotations are used to specify how a class or its fields should be serialized and deserialized. The @JsonSerializable annotation is commonly used to indicate that a class should be processed for JSON serialization.
